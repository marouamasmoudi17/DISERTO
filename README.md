# DISERTO

The Data Integration based on Semantic Enhancement and RML (RDF Mapping Language) mappings TOol called DISERTO automatically 
generates RML mappings through domain ontology and thesaurus to categorize the semantics behind the data. 
This tool follows three main steps: 
1/ extracting relevant metadata (data sechma), 
2/ mapping metadata to a domain ontology by taking advantages of RDF quads, 
3/ and finally generating RML mappings.
